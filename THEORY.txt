rhythm detection is a 5 step conversion process:

1) Song -> Amplitude/Time.
definition:
- Amplitude: Density offset of sound waves
- Time: Seconds into the song
handled by:
- Human: ear drum
- computer: microphone or song file

2) Amplitude/Time -> Frequency/Amplitude/Time
definition:
- Frequency: sine waves of consistent rate
- Amplitude: Volume of the frequencies
- Time: Seconds into the song
handled by:
- Human: basilar membrane in the ear
- computer: FFT loop

3) Frequency/Amplitude/Time -> Sound/Amplitude/Time
definition:
- Sound: Collection of frequencies from a single source (e.g. drum, instrument, voice, etc)
- Amplitude: Volume of the sound
- Time: Seconds into the song
handled by:
- Human: filtering/associative algorithms in the low level brain (no memory required)
- computer: ???? HARD
thoughts:
- a sound can have an overall tone like a piano note, or none at all like a drum beat
- a sound is made of both frequency & amplitude and their changes over a span of time
- a short sound's beat usually occurs halfway between beginning and end
- a long sound's beat either occurs at its start or end

4) Sound/Amplitude/Time -> Rhythm/Amplitude/Time
definition:
- Rhythm: Change/occurance rate of a particular sound
- Amplitude: Dominance of the rhythm (probably equivalent to the dominance of the sound).
- Time: Seconds into the song
handled by:
- Human: predictive algorithm in subconcious cognition
- computer: ???? MEDIUM - volume/frequency change filter of the whole sound

5) Rhythm/Amplitude/Time -> Dominant Rhythm/Time
definition:
- Dominant Rhythm: The rhythm you dance or tap to.
- Time: Seconds into the song
handled by:
- Human: conscious level cognition, we can choose the rhythm we dance to, but one is usually dominant
- computer: ???? EASY - probably just the loudest, all others likely harmonics
